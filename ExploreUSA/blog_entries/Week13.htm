    which is half done and have made the site responsive still need to work on that.

    Did couple of experiments on Webservices,<br>
    Last.FM API ---In this experiment, I have made use of Last.FM API which makes GET requests to the server.
                By making parametric changes changes in the URL,the request is sent.As per choice, the response
                is given in XML format or JSON format. I have used a C# code that uses class
<b>XmlTextReader</b> to read the XML contents and use the node names. These parameters are appended in a HTML code.
                As the user enters an artist names or album name, the API returns with the best matching results
    <br>
    Drag and Drop with HTML 5:
    This experiment explores the drag and drop and file api
    provided by HTML5. In this example when you drag an image from your computer and
    drop it in the box provided below, an HTML5 drop event is fired, in which the file
    that is dropped is checked whether it is and image file or not. If the file is an
    image then the file is read and displayed in a separate box provided below.

    Next week planing to explore and do experiments on api related to project and develop more project web pages.
