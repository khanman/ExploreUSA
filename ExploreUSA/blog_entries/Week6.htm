<h3>Week 6 - CS5610</h3>
<p>
<p>
    Exploring and using Javascript since few weeks.Did a couple of experiment on learing 
    Ajax.It was fun learing ajax,in which content required is loaded and not the whole page can do many other
    things with it still exploring.The page is not refreshed, hence lot of time is saved from laoding again.

    Worked on auto complete feature using google APIS, last week worked on Google Maps and this week made the location area auto-complete.
    Integrated both the components and have presented as a experiment.

<p>
    Next week planing to explore and do experiments on Apis, dataview and loading on a page scroll.
    I had a discussion with prof jose about the project he has asked me to go ahead with the topic i presented to him,
    so in the coming weeks will start working on it.
