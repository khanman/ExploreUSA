<h3>Week 7 - CS5610</h3>
<p>
<p>
    Had been working on my home page and finally uploaded, will make more changes during the course of time.
    It is a single page but looks like there are 3 seperate pages, The links are provided on the top which will help navigate
    to the required pages. There is arrow picture next to Experiments, Project and Links which will help you move up and down the page
    without the help of the scroll bar or scroll wheel of the mouse. The navigation can be done using the Top nav bar and arrows.
