<h3>Week 14 - CS5610</h3>

<p>
<p>
    Project:Implemented Explore and cities feature.
</p>
<p>
    This week has mostly been about testing, debugging, making final changes to CSS and so on.
    On the functionality side, I have added <strong>explore feature</strong> where user can click on any part of the map and it will redirect to 
    a page having more details about that state.
    <strong>Cities Feature</strong>where the user can enter city name and view all the places to visit in that state.
