                <h4>FootBall</h4>
                Football refers to a number of sports that involve, to varying degrees,
                kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. The most popular of these
                sports worldwide is association football, more commonly known as just
                "football" or "soccer". Unqualified, the word football applies to whichever
                form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the
                word appears, including association football, as well as American football,
                Australian rules football, Canadian football, Gaelic football, rugby league,
                rugby union,[1] and other related games. These variations of football are
                known as football codes.
                Various forms of football can be identified in history, often as popular
                peasant games. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification
                of these games at English public schools in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
                [2][3] The influence and power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football
                to spread to areas of British influence outside of the directly controlled Empire,[4]
                though by the end of the nineteenth century, distinct regional codes were already
                developing: Gaelic Football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local
                traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[5] In 1888, The Football
                League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football
                competitions. During the twentieth century, several of the various kinds of football
                grew to become among the most popular team sports in the world.[6]

                <h4>Cricket</h4>
                Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players on a field at
                the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard long pitch. Each team takes it in turn
                to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields. Each turn is known as
                an innings.
                The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman who attempts to hit the ball with his bat
                far enough for him to run to the other end of the pitch and score a run. Each batsman
                continues batting until he is out. The batting team continues batting until ten batsmen
                are out, at which point the teams switch roles and the fielding team comes in to bat.

                <h4>Tennis</h4>
                Tennis is a sport people usually play individually against a single opponent (singles)
                or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a racquet that
                is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a
                net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such
                a way that the opponent is not able to play a good return.
                Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages.
                The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racquet, including wheelchair users.
                The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century
                as "lawn tennis".[1] It had close connections both to various field ("lawn") games
                such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racquet sport of real tennis.
                During most of the 19th-century in fact, the term "tennis" referred to real tennis,
                not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel Sybil (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere
                announces that he will "go down to Hampton Court and play tennis."[2]
