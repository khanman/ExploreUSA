History[edit]



The Huntington Avenue YMCA circa 1920, site of the "Evening Institute for Younger Men"
Founded in 1898 as the "Evening Institute for Younger Men" at the Huntington Avenue YMCA, the first evening class was held on October 3, 1898. The School of Law was formally established that year with the assistance of an Advisory Committee consisting of Dean James Barr Ames of the Harvard University School of Law, Dean Samuel Bennett of the Boston University School of Law, and Judge James R. Dunbar. In 1903, the first Automobile Engineering School of the country was established. In 1907, the School of Commerce and Finance was established. In 1909, the school began offering day classes. In 1916, a bill was introduced with the view to incorporate Northeastern College into a definite university system. In March 1916, after considerable debate and investigation, the bill was successfully passed, and the corporate existence of Northeastern College commenced.
On March 30, 1917, Frank Palmer Speare was inaugurated as the first President of Northeastern College. In March 1923 a significant step was taken, the University securing from the Massachusetts Legislature the general degree granting power, with the exception of the A.B., the S.B., and the medical degrees. For a long time it had been felt that the work of the University was sufficiently extensive to warrant this significant step and, in a sense, the securing of the general degree granting power is the culmination of a long period of development marking the gradual growth from an evening engineering institute to a high grade university, offering most of the things universities customarily offer.
As a preliminary to the securing of the degree granting privileges, on March 15, 1922, the name of the University had been changed from Northeastern College to Northeastern University, a name that more adequately covered the multitude of activities conducted by the University.[9]
In 1935, the College of Liberal Arts was added to Northeastern, and the university's name was simplified to "Northeastern University."[citation needed] In 1937 The Northeastern University Corporation was established, creating a board of trustees made up of 31 members of the NU Corporation and 8 members of the YMCA. In 1948 Northeastern separated itself completely from the YMCA.[10]
Following World War II, Northeastern began admitting women, and in the boom of postwar college-bound students, Northeastern created the College of Education (1953), University College (now called the College of Professional Studies)[11] (1960), the College of Pharmacy and the College of Nursing (1964). The College of Pharmacy and the College of Nursing were subsequently combined into the Bouvé College of Health Sciences. Northeastern also added the College of Criminal Justice (1967) and the College of Computer Science (1982), since renamed the College of Computer and Information Science.
Similar to a number of other urban universities, Northeastern began as a commuter school with many part-time and evening students, and by the early 1980s had grown to nearly 60,000 enrollees. By 1989-1990 the enrollment was reduced to about 40,000 full, part time and evening students, and in 1990 the university had its first graduating class with more live-on-campus than commuter students. President Kenneth Ryder retired in 1989 and the University adopted a slow and systemic system of change. Historically, the University had been accepting between 7,500 and 10,000 students per year based on applications of about 15,000 to 20,000 with acceptance rates between 50% and 75% depending on the program. The attrition rates were huge, with a nearly 25% dropout rate among freshmen and only a 50% graduation rate. The incoming class of 1984 accepted 5,672 undergraduate full time day students, yet only some 2,287 graduated in 1989. When President John Curry left office in 1996 the university population stood at about 25,000. Richard Freeland decided to focus on the kinds of students who were already graduating as the prime demographic of students accepted[citation needed] In the early 1990s, the university reduced the number of enrolled students in order to become a "smaller, better" university and began building more residence halls on campus. It cut its freshman class size from around 4,500 students to 2,800 students.[citation needed]


Robert J. Shillman Hall constructed in 1995
From 1996 to 2006, under President Richard Freeland, average SAT scores increased more than 200 points, retention rates rose dramatically, and applications doubled.[citation needed] President Freeland oversaw Northeastern's largest expansion ever, with $485 million in new facilities, including residence halls, academic and research facilities, and athletic centers. The institution also became substantially more selective, leading to a more academically talented student body.[citation needed]
During the transition, students experienced a reorganization of the co-operative education system to better integrate classroom learning with workplace experience.[citation needed] The university also switched its full-time undergraduate and graduate programs to a new academic calendar comprising two traditional semesters and two summer "minimesters," replacing the four-quarter system. This new calendar allowed students to delve more deeply into their academic courses and to experience longer, more substantive co-op placements.
Throughout the transformation, President Freeland's oft-repeated goal was to crack the Top 100 of the U.S. News rankings,[citation needed] which was accomplished in 2005. With this goal accomplished and the transformation from commuting school to national research university complete, he stepped down from the presidency on August 15, 2006. His successor, Dr. Joseph Aoun, formerly a dean at University of Southern California,[12] implemented a decentralized management model, giving the academic deans of the university more control over their own budgets, faculty hiring decisions, and fundraising.


Northeastern's historic Ell Hall on Huntington Avenue
As part of Northeastern's five-year, $75 million Academic Investment Plan,[13] the University is concentrating on three areas: undergraduate education, core graduate professional programs, and centers of research excellence. The Plan centers around the addition of 100 tenured and tenure-track professors between 2004 and 2009. This plan was recently expanded to provide for the hiring of an additional 300 tenure and tenure-track faculty in interdisciplinary fields. Aoun has also placed more emphasis on improving town relations by reaching out to leaders of the communities surrounding the university.[14] In addition, Aoun has created more academic partnerships with other institutions in the Boston area including Tufts, Hebrew College and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.[citation needed]
Under Aoun's leadership, the university continues to climb in the rankings.[citation needed] In the 2014 edition of U.S. News and World Report's "Best Colleges Guide," Northeastern increased its ranking to 49th, up 7 spots from 2013.

Satellite campuses[edit]

In addition to Northeastern's main Boston campus, the university operates a number of remote undergraduate locations Massachusetts. The University operates the Kostas Research Institute in Burlington, a Financial District campus in the Hilton Hotel in downtown Boston, a Dedham Campus in Dedham, Massachusetts, and a Marine Science Center in Nahant, Massachusetts.[15]
Additionally, the University has launched two full service graduate campuses. The first in Charlotte, North Carolina opened October 2011 and a second campus in Seattle in 2013.[16][17][18] The University has additional plans to open campuses in Silicon Valley (California), Austin, Texas, and Minneapolis in the future.[19]
Admissions[edit]

For the 116th entering class (fall 2013), Northeastern received 47,364 applications for 2,800 seats.[7] The middle 50 percent of the enrolling class had test scores that ranged from 1990-2160 on the SAT and 30-33 on the ACT.[20]
Academics[edit]

Northeastern offers undergraduate majors in 65 departments. At the graduate level, there are more than 125 programs. Academics at Northeastern is grounded in the integration of classroom studies with experiential learning opportunities, including cooperative education, student research, service learning, and global experience. The university's cooperative education program places about 5,000 students annually with more than 2,500 co-op employers in Boston, across the United States, and around the globe. In 2010, College Prowler gave Northeastern an "A-" rating for the quality of classes, professors, and overall academic environment.[21]

Honors Program[edit]
The University Honors Program offers selected students an enhanced curriculum. Starting with the First Year Reading Project and moving on to participating in a wide range of courses during the undergraduate years, the program gives students a variety of academic choices. The culminating experience is advanced specialty work in a major field through college-specific choices including specialized advanced honors seminars and an independent research project.[23] In addition, students in the Honors Program exclusively can live in a Living-Learning Community housed in West Villages C[24] and F. Since Fall 2009, first-year Honors students are housed in the North and West Towers of the newly constructed International Village residence hall.
Senior Capstone[edit]
The Senior Capstone is an advanced level course related to the student's major. The course requires the student to integrate what they have learned through their academic coursework and their experiential learning experience (co-op, research, study abroad, and service).[25][26][27][28]
Pre-med program[edit]
The university recently partnered with Tufts University School of Medicine to create an early acceptance BA/MD Program.[29] Northeastern's campus is just a few blocks from the Longwood Medical and Academic Area where Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Dental Medicine are located along with their associated world class teaching hospitals. These institutions provide NU pre-med students with significant internship opportunities. Boston is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology industry
Study abroad[edit]
Northeastern has semester-long study abroad programs with placements in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Some participating schools include: University of Edinburgh, Scotland; Reims Management School, France; European School of Business, Germany; University of Cape Town, South Africa; University of Cambridge and London School of Economics, England; University of Auckland, New Zealand; Swinburne University of Technology, Australia; Obirin University, Japan; American College of Thessaloniki, Greece and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Chile and also Antarctica[30]
Northeastern's International Business program is a member of the International Partnership of Business Schools. Through this program International Business students have the opportunity to be awarded a dual-degree from Northeastern as well as from a sister school in Europe, Mexico or Hong Kong.
Northeastern also has the notable Dialogues of Civilizations program, which features dozens of one month-long programs (usually taking place in the summer) where a faculty member will lead a group of students in the country of their choice. A sort of "mini" study abroad, each program has an area of focus - for example, the Geneva program focuses on small arms and multilateral negotiations while the South Africa program is based in non-governmental organizations. This program is meant to be a communicative experience and an exchange of ideas and cultures. It is open to all majors and all years, and is the most popular study abroad option at Northeastern.[citation needed]
Since the arrival of President Aoun in 2006, the school has also been emphasizing co-op abroad, in an effort to make the school more global and internationally engaged. There are many programs being offered including social entrepreneurship in the Dominican Republic, Belize, and South Africa.
Northeastern also offers a program called NUin for first-year students who choose to spend their first semester studying abroad. In 2012, 500 students enrolled in the NUin program in destinations of England, Ireland, Greece, Australia, and Costa Rica.

In 2004, Northeastern was one of six institutions selected by the National Science Foundation as a center for research in nanotechnology. In 2010, Northeastern was granted $12 million by an alum for a Homeland security research facility,[47] to be named the George J. Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security, after its chief benefactor.[47]
Faculty[edit]
See also: List of Northeastern University faculty
Many of Northeastern's 973 full-time and part-time faculty members have garnered national and international acclaim for their achievements in teaching and research, with particular strength in interdisciplinary scholarship. Northeastern faculty members direct more than 35 research and education centers, including a National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center, an NSF Nanomanufacturing Center, and two NSF Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship programs.
Co-op/internship program[edit]
Northeastern has one of the largest co-op/internship programs in the world.[48] Started in 1909, NU's co-op program is one of the oldest in the nation. In the co-op program, students alternate periods of academic study with periods of paid professional employment related to their major. Most majors offer a four-year graduation option with fewer co-op placements, but the five-year program is more popular with students. The co-op program typically spring of the second year or fall of the third year (after a more traditional program for the first semesters on campus).
Co-op placements range from small dynamic start-up companies to large multinational companies with thousands of employees, including many Fortune 500 corporations. The program also places students with government agencies, branches of government, nonprofits, and non-governmental organizations. Northeastern students can be found interning in the United States Congress, the White House, United Nations, and at NASA. Student placements usually last six months, and are mostly paid. Students may live in the university residence halls on campus during co-op employment, and the university currently leases housing for students co-oping in New York City and Washington, D.C. and assists elsewhere.
Northeastern University is also a partner with the Boston Youth Fund, which is run by the Boston Youth council and provides summer job and enrichment placement for the City of Boston.
Accreditation[edit]
Northeastern University is accredited by New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC)[49]

The NU mascot is Paws. The school colors are red and black with white trim. The fight song, "All Hail, Northeastern", was composed by Charles A. Pethybridge, Class of 1932.
Some notable athletes have played for Northeastern's sports teams. Dan Ross played football at Northeastern long before setting the Super Bowl record for receptions in a game. Reggie Lewis still holds the men's basketball career scoring record. Carlos Peña was named Major League Baseball's American League Comeback Player of the Year in 2007 and an AL Gold Glove winner in 2008. The U.S. Olympic women's ice hockey teams have included Northeastern alumni Shelley Looney and Chanda Gunn.
The baseball team has competed in one College World Series and played in the NCAA regionals seven times.[50]
In its first year in the CAA, the men's basketball team finished in 6th place (out of 12 teams) and advanced to the semifinals of the conference tournament. The CAA proved to be a competitive conference in the 2006 NCAA Basketball Tournament, as George Mason University advanced all the way to the Final Four. In 2007, its second year in the CAA, the women's track team captured the conference championship, while the volleyball team finished second. The women's basketball team won 10 more games in 2008 than the previous year, the biggest one-year turnaround in the CAA, and advanced to the tournament quarterfinals.
Northeastern's men's and women's hockey teams compete in the Hockey East Conference. During the 2007–08 season, the men's team ranked as high at #7 in the country and held the top spot in the conference before finishing the season in sixth place in Hockey East. Both teams also participate in the annual Beanpot tournament between the four major Boston-area colleges. Northeastern's men's team has won the annual event 4 times in its 54-year history, while the women's team has captured the Beanpot 14 times. During the 2008–2009 season, the men's team ranked as high as 3rd in the nation and held the top spot in Hockey East until the last weekend of the season; the team made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1994, the Beanpot championship game for the first time since 2004, and goalie Brad Thiessen made the Hobey Hat Trick, only the second Northeastern player to do so.
The Northeastern Crew team consistently ranks as one of the top 10 teams in the nation.[51] In the 2008 National Championship, the team made the Grand Finals and placed fourth behind University of Wisconsin–Madison, University of Washington, and University of California, Berkeley, while beating Brown University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University.[52]
Northeastern offers 40 club sports, including judo, rugby, lacrosse, squash, cycling and ultimate frisbee. In 2005 the women's rugby team finished third in the nation in Division II, while in the same year the men's rugby team won the largest annual tournament in the United States. The men's lacrosse team began the 2008 season ranked in the Top 10 nationally. The men's and women's squash team finished the 2008 season ranked in the Top 20 nationally. In the 2008–2009 academic year the Northeastern Club Field Hockey and Women's Basketball teams won their respective National Championships. From 2007 to 2009, the Northeastern Club Baseball team won three straight New England Club Baseball Association championships.[53] On May 25, 2010 the club baseball team defeated Penn State to win the National Club Baseball Association Division II World Series and national championship.[54]
Citing sparse attendance, numerous losing seasons and the expense to renovate Parsons Field to an acceptable standard, the university Board of Trustees voted on November 20, 2009, to end the football program. According to president Joseph Aoun, "Leadership requires that we make these choices. This decision allows us to focus on our existing athletic programs."[55]
