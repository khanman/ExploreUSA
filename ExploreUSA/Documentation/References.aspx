              Coming to the end of web development, I would definitely like to thank <strong>Prof. Jose</strong> for this wonderful course. The fact that we could chose any topic under the sun let our creativity flow. 
              While we started designing the website, i learnt a excessive amount of new technologies like <Strong>HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, AJAX and most importantly ASP.NET and C#.</Strong>
                <br>
              All through this, a very useful resource that I used to solve my technical doubts and refer to was Professor's Website. All minute details of the technology are explained very clearly on his site and it helped me through most of the things on my project.
              Prof. Jose helped us with his experiments on jQuery/Web services which were extremely resourceful. I am very grateful to both of them for sharing their knowledge and experience with us.
              <br>
                My teaching assistant, <strong>Ketki Sudhir Gandhe </strong> was extremely helpful and always guided me well by giving constructive feedback every week. <br>
